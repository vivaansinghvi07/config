# Config 

These are the configuration files on my computer. It runs on macOS, using the following:

- Homebrew
- iTerm2
- Zsh

It includes custom commands, a custom Neovim configuration, a custom Zsh runtime, Homebrew formulae, and whatever else I decide to add.

To setup everything, simply run the following:

```
$ sudo zsh ./setup.sh
```
